\entry{Spring 2020}
			{Theory and Methodology of Political Science}
			{\ucr}
			{This course will lay out the enterprise of empirical research: the structure and content of theories, the formulation of testable hypotheses, and the processes of generating and gathering data. Then discuss how to examine these data, as well as the logic of empirical tests, the evaluation of relationships between two variables, the consideration of competing hypotheses, and the strengths and weaknesses of alternative research designs. Finally, we explore some of the most common statistical tools that political scientists use to answer empirical questions, focusing on how multiple regression analysis and experiments can be used to identify causal relationships and answer questions about the political world.
