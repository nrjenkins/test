## Introduction to Data Science with Stata and R

In this workshop, you will learn how to use Stata and R to clean data, create effective visualizations, and models for inference. In this workshop, we will learn the following:

1. Load a data set in Stata and R and clean it for analysis

2. Calculate descriptive statistics and visualize your data in Stata and R

3. Analyze data with basic modeling techniques in Stata and R

4. Visualize the results of your model and generate predictions
